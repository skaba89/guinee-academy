## 1. Executive Summary

Guinée Academy (guinee-academy) is a modern, multi-tenant school management platform built with React + Vite (frontend) and FastAPI + PostgreSQL (backend). It targets **French-speaking African educational institutions** (K-12 and higher education) with a unique value proposition:

- **Full French-first design** (UI, i18n, documentation in French)
- **Multi-tenant SaaS architecture** (SuperAdmin manages multiple schools)
- **On-premise deployment option** (critical for Africa where internet connectivity is unreliable)
- **Mobile-first PWA** with Capacitor for native iOS/Android builds
- **GDPR/RGPD compliance** built-in

However, the codebase analysis reveals that while Guinée Academy has an **impressive breadth of UI pages (~75 admin routes, 50+ components)**, many features are **front-end shells with limited backend wiring** or lack depth compared to mature competitors.

### Key Competitive Gaps

| Gap | Impact |
|-----|--------|
| No LMS / course content delivery | Critical for universities |
| No online payment integration (Stripe, Mobile Money, Wave) | Critical for Africa |
| No timetable auto-generation algorithm | Teachers manually create schedules |
| No SMS notification system | Essential in low-internet regions |
| No biometric attendance | Growing expectation |
| No transcript generation | University must-have |
| No parent mobile app (only PWA) | Parents expect native apps |

## 5. TOP 20 Missing Features

Based on the competitive analysis and codebase audit, here are the **TOP 20 features** that Guinée Academy lacks or has only as stubs, ranked by strategic importance for the Francophone Africa market:

### 🔴 Critical (Must-Have for Market Entry)

#### 1. Online Payment Integration (Stripe, Mobile Money, Wave)
**Current State**: Invoice/Payment management exists in UI, but no real payment gateway integration.  
**Competitors**: PowerSchool, Gradelink, Fedena all have Stripe/PayPal.  
**Why Critical**: African parents prefer mobile money (MTN MoMo, Orange Money, Wave). This is THE #1 revenue enabler.  
**Effort**: Medium — integrate Stripe + mobile money APIs.  
**Backend Gap**: No `online_payments`, `payment_gateway`, `mobile_money` models/endpoints.

#### 2. Timetable Auto-Generation Algorithm
**Current State**: Manual schedule CRUD only (`Schedule.tsx` 175 LOC).  
**Competitors**: PowerSchool, Pronote, Fedena, OpenEduCat all have constraint-based auto-scheduling.  
**Why Critical**: Timetable creation is one of the most painful admin tasks. Auto-generation is a major selling point.  
**Effort**: High — requires constraint satisfaction algorithm (consider OR-Tools or custom genetic algorithm).  
**Backend Gap**: No `timetable_engine`, `scheduling_constraints` endpoints.

#### 3. SMS Notification System
**Current State**: Only push notifications and in-app messaging.  
**Competitors**: All major SIS have SMS integration (Twilio, Africa's Talking, Bulk SMS).  
**Why Critical**: Internet penetration in Francophone Africa averages 30-50%. SMS is the reliable channel for parents without smartphones.  
**Effort**: Medium — integrate Twilio/Africa's Talking API.  
**Backend Gap**: No `sms_service`, `sms_templates`, `sms_log` models/endpoints.

#### 4. Assignment & Homework Management System
**Current State**: `TeacherHomework.tsx` exists but no dedicated assignment tracking with submission, grading, and deadline management.  
**Competitors**: All LMS platforms have full assignment workflow (create → submit → grade → feedback).  
**Why Critical**: Teachers need to assign work, students submit digitally, parents see deadlines. Core education feature.  
**Effort**: Medium — new `assignments` table, submission workflow, file upload.  
**Backend Gap**: No `assignments`, `submissions`, `assignment_grades` models.

#### 5. Online Exam / Quiz System
**Current State**: No exam functionality at all.  
**Competitors**: Moodle, Schoology, PowerSchool UC all have comprehensive exam engines.  
**Why Critical**: Universities need online exams. Post-COVID, hybrid education demands it.  
**Effort**: High — question bank, timer, anti-cheating, auto-grading, analytics.  
**Backend Gap**: No `exams`, `questions`, `exam_attempts`, `exam_results` models.

#### 6. Official Transcript Generation
**Current State**: Report cards exist but no official transcript builder with cumulative GPA, credits, academic history.  
**Competitors**: PowerSchool, Gradelink, Ellucian all generate official transcripts.  
**Why Critical**: Universities MUST issue transcripts. Without this, the platform is incomplete for higher education.  
**Effort**: Medium — PDF generation with school branding, academic history aggregation.  
**Backend Gap**: No `transcript`, `academic_record`, `gpa_calculation` models.

### 🟡 High Priority (Competitive Differentiation)

#### 7. Biometric Attendance (Fingerprint / Facial Recognition)
**Current State**: Only manual attendance and QR code check-in.  
**Competitors**: PowerSchool, Pronote, Fedena support biometric hardware integration.  
**Why Critical**: Reduces buddy-punching in universities, impressive demo feature for school administrators.  
**Effort**: High — hardware integration, biometric API, edge device management.  
**Backend Gap**: No `biometric_data`, `biometric_logs`, `device_management` models.

#### 8. Transportation Management Module
**Current State**: Not implemented.  
**Competitors**: PowerSchool, Fedena, OpenEduCat all have bus routes, stops, tracking.  
**Why Critical**: Schools with bus fleets need route planning, parent notifications for delays, and student safety.  
**Effort**: Medium — route management, GPS tracking integration, parent notifications.  
**Backend Gap**: No `transport_routes`, `transport_stops`, `transport_assignments` models.

#### 9. Hostel / Dormitory Management
**Current State**: Not implemented.  
**Competitors**: Ellucian, Fedena, OpenEduCat have room allocation, fees, maintenance.  
**Why Critical**: Universities with dormitories need room assignment, allocation, fees, and maintenance tracking.  
**Effort**: Medium — room inventory, allocation system, fee integration.  
**Backend Gap**: No `hostels`, `rooms`, `room_allocations`, `hostel_fees` models.

#### 10. Scholarship & Financial Aid Management
**Current State**: `Sponsorships.tsx` exists (456 LOC) but no formal scholarship criteria, application, or disbursement workflow.  
**Competitors**: Ellucian, PowerSchool have comprehensive financial aid modules.  
**Why Critical**: Many African students depend on scholarships. Schools need to manage applications, criteria, disbursements.  
**Effort**: Medium — scholarship criteria engine, application workflow, disbursement tracking.  
**Backend Gap**: No `scholarships`, `scholarship_applications`, `aid_disbursements` models.

#### 11. Health Records & Immunization Tracking
**Current State**: Not implemented.  
**Competitors**: PowerSchool, Veracross, Infinite Campus have full health modules.  
**Why Critical**: Schools must track student health, allergies, immunizations. Post-COVID requirement.  
**Effort**: Medium — health records CRUD, immunization schedule, medical alerts.  
**Backend Gap**: No `health_records`, `immunizations`, `medical_alerts` models.

#### 12. Cafeteria / Food Service Management
**Current State**: Not implemented.  
**Competitors**: PowerSchool, OpenEduCat have meal plans, pre-ordering, nutritional tracking.  
**Why Critical**: Schools with cafeterias need meal planning, prepaid cards, consumption tracking.  
**Effort**: Medium — meal plan management, card integration, ordering system.  
**Backend Gap**: No `cafeteria_menus`, `meal_plans`, `cafeteria_orders` models.

### 🟢 Medium Priority (Retention & Growth)

#### 13. Course Content / Lesson Delivery (Full LMS)
**Current State**: `Elearning.tsx` is a UI shell (455 LOC) — no real content delivery.  
**Competitors**: Moodle, Schoology, Canvas are full LMS platforms.  
**Why Critical**: Schools increasingly want LMS features. Without content delivery, it's just an admin tool.  
**Effort**: Very High — full LMS is a product by itself. Consider integration with Moodle instead.  
**Backend Gap**: No `courses`, `lessons`, `course_enrollments`, `lesson_progress` models.

#### 14. SCORM / xAPI Compliance
**Current State**: Not implemented.  
**Competitors**: Schoology, Moodle fully support SCORM packages.  
**Why Critical**: Teachers use pre-made SCORM content packages. Without SCORM support, content ecosystem is limited.  
**Effort**: High — SCORM player, xAPI learning record store.  
**Backend Gap**: No SCORM/xAPI infrastructure.

#### 15. Plagiarism Detection Integration
**Current State**: Not implemented.  
**Competitors**: Schoology, PowerSchool integrate with Turnitin/Urkund.  
**Why Critical**: Universities require plagiarism checking for submissions.  
**Effort**: Low-Medium — API integration with Turnitin or open-source alternatives.  
**Backend Gap**: No plagiarism detection service.

#### 16. Adaptive Learning / Personalized Paths
**Current State**: `AIInsights.tsx` has basic client-side risk scoring, not real ML.  
**Competitors**: PowerSchool has MTSS framework, some have adaptive learning.  
**Why Critical**: Growing demand for personalized learning. Good differentiation opportunity.  
**Effort**: Very High — requires ML infrastructure, data pipeline, recommendation engine.  
**Backend Gap**: No ML pipeline, recommendation engine, or adaptive content system.

#### 17. API Developer Portal & Webhooks
**Current State**: REST API exists but no developer documentation portal or webhook system.  
**Competitors**: PowerSchool has an API marketplace, Schoology has developer platform.  
**Why Critical**: Schools need integrations with 3rd-party tools (accounting, analytics, gov reporting).  
**Effort**: Medium — Swagger/OpenAPI docs, webhook registration, event system.  
**Backend Gap**: No webhook registry, developer keys, API rate limiting.

#### 18. Advanced Role-Based Dashboard Builder
**Current State**: Fixed dashboards for each role.  
**Competitors**: PowerSchool, Ellucian have customizable dashboard widgets.  
**Why Critical**: Administrators want to see what matters to them. Custom dashboards increase stickiness.  
**Effort**: Medium — widget system, drag-and-drop layout (react-grid-layout is already installed), persistence.  
**Backend Gap**: No `dashboard_configs`, `widget_definitions` models.

#### 19. Bus / Vehicle GPS Tracking Integration
**Current State**: Not implemented (part of transportation gap).  
**Competitors**: Some SIS have real-time bus tracking.  
**Why Critical**: Safety feature — parents track children's school bus in real-time. Very popular in emerging markets.  
**Effort**: Medium — GPS device integration, real-time map, parent notification.  
**Backend Gap**: No `gps_devices`, `location_history` models.

#### 20. Multi-Currency & Franc CFA Zone Support
**Current State**: `useCurrency` hook exists but no multi-currency or CFA franc-specific handling.  
**Competitors**: Global platforms support multi-currency.  
**Why Critical**: Francophone Africa uses CFA franc (XOF/XAF) across 14 countries. Special handling needed for zone-specific requirements.  
**Effort**: Low-Medium — currency conversion, CFA zone settings, multi-currency invoice support.  
**Backend Gap**: No `currencies`, `exchange_rates`, `tenant_currency` configuration.
