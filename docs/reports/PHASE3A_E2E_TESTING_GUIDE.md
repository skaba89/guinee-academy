---

## Running Tests

### Run All Tests

```bash
# All tests
npx playwright test

# Expected: 36+ tests passing
# Time: ~3-5 minutes
```

### Run Specific Test File

```bash
# Authentication tests only
npx playwright test tests/e2e/badges-auth.spec.ts

# Display tests
npx playwright test tests/e2e/badges-display.spec.ts

# Security tests
npx playwright test tests/e2e/badges-security.spec.ts

# Notification tests
npx playwright test tests/e2e/badges-notifications.spec.ts
```

### Run Specific Test

```bash
# Run one test by name
npx playwright test -g "Student can view own badges"

# Run tests matching pattern
npx playwright test -g "Authentication"
```

### Run by Browser

```bash
# Chromium only
npx playwright test --project=chromium

# Firefox only
npx playwright test --project=firefox

# Safari/WebKit only
npx playwright test --project=webkit

# Mobile Chrome
npx playwright test --project=mobile-chrome

# Mobile Safari
npx playwright test --project=mobile-safari
```

### Debug Mode

```bash
# Interactive debug mode (step through code)
npx playwright test --debug

# Headed mode (see browser)
npx playwright test --headed

# Slow motion (1 second per action)
npx playwright test --slow-mo=1000

# Combine: headed + debug
npx playwright test --headed --debug
```

### Generate & View Report

```bash
# Run tests and generate HTML report
npx playwright test

# View report
npx playwright show-report

# Opens at: http://localhost:9322 (or similar)
```

---

## Test Organization

### Test Structure

Each test file follows this pattern:

```typescript
test.describe('Feature - Section', () => {
  
  test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
    // Setup before each test
    await loginAsUser(page);
  });
  
  test('Test case description', async ({ page }) => {
    // Arrange
    await page.goto('/path');
    
    // Act
    await page.click('[data-testid="button"]');
    
    // Assert
    await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="result"]')).toBeVisible();
  });
});
```

### Test Selectors

All tests use `data-testid` attributes for reliability:

```typescript
// Login
[data-testid="email-input"]
[data-testid="password-input"]
[data-testid="login-button"]

// Badges
[data-testid="badge-card"]
[data-testid="badge-grid"]
[data-testid="badge-display"]
[data-testid="badge-name"]

// Navigation
[data-testid="achievements-page"]
[data-testid="leaderboard"]
[data-testid="dashboard"]
```

- Browser console logs

### CI Integration

For GitHub Actions:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/e2e.yml
name: E2E Tests

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    services:
      postgres:
        image: postgres:15
        # ... service config

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18
      
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npx playwright install --with-deps
      
      - run: npm run dev &
      - run: npx playwright test
      
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        if: always()
        with:
          name: playwright-report
          path: playwright-report/
```

---

## Debugging Failed Tests

### 1. Run in Headed Mode

```bash
# See the browser while test runs
npx playwright test --headed --project=chromium
```

### 2. Use Slow Motion

```bash
# Slow down each action by 2 seconds
npx playwright test --slow-mo=2000
```

### 3. Debug Single Test

```bash
# Stop at each step, inspect state
npx playwright test -g "Student can view" --debug
```

**Debug UI Controls:**
- Step over (next action)
- Step into
- Step out
- Continue
- Pause/Resume

### 4. Check Screenshots

```bash
# After test failure, screenshot saved to:
# playwright-report/[testname].png
```

### 5. Common Issues

#### Issue: "Browser timeout"
```bash
# Increase timeout
TEST_TIMEOUT=60000 npx playwright test
```

#### Issue: "Test data not found"
```bash
# Seed database first
npm run db:seed

# Then run tests
npx playwright test
```

#### Issue: "Element not found"
- Check `data-testid` attribute exists in component
- Verify page actually loads to that element
- Wait longer with `waitForTimeout()`
- Use `waitFor({ state: 'visible' })`

#### Issue: "Cross-browser failures"
- Tests may behave differently in Firefox/Safari
- Check browser-specific issues in test results
- Some APIs (like `navigator.share`) only work in certain browsers

## Performance Benchmarks

Expected test execution times:

```
badges-auth.spec.ts:          ~45 seconds
badges-display.spec.ts:       ~60 seconds
badges-security.spec.ts:      ~55 seconds
badges-notifications.spec.ts: ~65 seconds

TOTAL:                        ~4-5 minutes
```

### Performance Tips

1. **Parallel Execution** (default)
   - 4 workers = faster
   - Set `workers: 1` for CI stability

2. **Reduce Timeouts** in CI
   ```bash
   CI=true npx playwright test  # 2 retries
   ```

3. **Run Specific Tests**
   ```bash
   npx playwright test tests/e2e/badges-auth.spec.ts  # Just auth
   ```

## Component Testing Checklist

Before running E2E tests, verify components have `data-testid`:

### Pages
- [ ] `/achievements` - All selectors
- [ ] `/admin/badges` - All admin selectors
- [ ] `/class/:id` - Student rows
- [ ] `/profile` - Badge section

### Components
- [ ] `BadgeCard` - Badge display selectors
- [ ] `BadgeGrid` - Grid & filter selectors
- [ ] `BadgeNotification` - Notification selectors
- [ ] `ClassBadgeLeaderboard` - Leaderboard selectors

### Forms
- [ ] Award badge form
- [ ] Filter form
- [ ] Sort select

---

## Advanced Testing

### Mock Data Fixtures

Create test data fixtures for consistency:

```typescript
// tests/e2e/fixtures/badge-data.ts
export const testBadges = [
  {
    id: 'badge-excellence',
    name: 'Excellence',
    type: 'PERFORMANCE',
    rarity: 'EPIC'
  },
  // ... more badges
];

export const testUsers = [
  {
    email: 'jean.dupont@student.sorbonne.fr',
    password: 'test_password_123',
    role: 'STUDENT'
  },
  // ... more users
];
```

### Database Seeding

```typescript
// tests/e2e/helpers/db.ts
export async function seedTestData() {
  // Insert test data into database
  await db.query('INSERT INTO badges_definitions...');
}

export async function cleanupTestData() {
  // Remove test data
  await db.query('DELETE FROM badges_definitions...');
}
```

### API Mocking

Mock API responses if needed:

```typescript
test('Badge award with network error', async ({ page }) => {
  // Intercept and mock API response
  await page.route('**/api/badges/award', route => {
    route.abort('failed');
  });
  
  // Test error handling
  await page.goto('/admin/badges');
  await page.click('[data-testid="award-btn"]');
  
  // Should show error message
  await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="error-message"]')).toBeVisible();
});
```
