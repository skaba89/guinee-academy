# PHASE 3b→3c TRANSITION GUIDE

**Last Updated:** January 27, 2026  
**Current Status:** PHASE 3b Data Prep Complete → Ready for 3c or Alternative Testing

---

## 🎯 Where We Stand

### PHASE 3b Completion Status: 90%
- ✅ **1,050 badge test records** created and loaded
- ✅ **7 performance indexes** created (15 total)
- ✅ **Database validation** completed (0.164ms query time)
- ✅ **K6 load testing tool** installed and configured
- ✅ **Load test scripts** created (baseline + full)
- ✅ **Documentation** generated
- ⚠️ **HTTP API testing** blocked by Kong infrastructure issue

### What's Working
```
✅ PostgreSQL Database
   - 1,050 badge records
   - Query time: 0.164ms (excellent)
   - Indexes: 15 optimized
   
✅ Authentication Service (GoTrue)
   - 73+ user accounts
   - JWT validation working
   
✅ All Docker Services (14 total)
   - PostgreSQL, Auth, REST, Realtime, Storage
   - Kong Gateway (but crashing on requests)
   
❌ Kong Gateway (HTTP API)
   - Worker processes crashing (signal 9)
   - Memory exhaustion from Lua initialization
```

## 🚀 THREE PATHS FORWARD

### PATH 1: Complete PHASE 3b with Direct PostgREST ⭐ RECOMMENDED

**Why:** Fast, realistic, bypasses Kong limitation

**Command:**
```bash
# Test directly on PostgREST port 3000 (skip Kong)
cd c:\Users\cheic\Documents\EduSchool\guinee-academy
.\k6.exe run --env BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000 load-tests/badges-load.js
```

**Expected Output:**
- K6 will execute the full 7.5 minute load test
- Real metrics: latency, throughput, error rates
- Test data: 1,050 badges, 6 concurrent scenarios
- Users: 10 → 50 → 100 (staged)

**Pros:**
- ✅ Bypasses Kong entirely
- ✅ Tests real PostgREST performance
- ✅ Can execute immediately
- ✅ Gives realistic API performance data

**Cons:**
- Only tests one layer (PostgREST, not Kong routing)
- Doesn't validate Kong/gateway performance

---

### PATH 2: Complete PHASE 3b with JavaScript Client

**Why:** Most realistic user simulation

**Setup:**
```bash
# Create load test using Supabase JS client
npm install @supabase/supabase-js
```

**Script Template:**
```javascript
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

const supabase = createClient(
  'http://localhost:8000',
  'eyJhbGc...' // anon key
)

// Load test with real client
for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  const { data } = await supabase
    .from('badges_definitions')
    .select('*')
    .limit(50)
  
  // Measure response time, etc.
}
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Uses official Supabase client
- ✅ Tests complete SDK performance
- ✅ Realistic browser/app simulation
- ✅ Can work despite Kong issues (retries)

**Cons:**
- Requires Node.js + package setup
- Slower to implement

---

### PATH 3: Skip to PHASE 3c (Mobile Testing)

**Why:** Move forward while infrastructure team fixes Kong

**Status:**
- ✅ Database fully prepared (1,050 badges, optimized)
- ✅ All backend components ready
- ✅ Can test mobile features independently

**Mobile Testing Can Include:**
- Badge display on mobile
- Achievement notifications
- Leaderboard rendering
- Offline functionality (if PWA)

**Pros:**
- ✅ Continues project momentum
- ✅ 3c doesn't depend on Kong
- ✅ Can come back to load testing later

**Cons:**
- PHASE 3b technically incomplete
- Load test results not finalized

---

## 💡 RECOMMENDATION

**Execute PATH 1 (Direct PostgREST Load Test) immediately:**

```powershell
# From project directory
cd c:\Users\cheic\Documents\EduSchool\guinee-academy

# Run the full load test
.\k6.exe run --env BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000 load-tests/badges-load.js

# Monitor output and save results
# Expected runtime: ~7.5 minutes
```

**Why This Path:**
1. ✅ Can execute right now
2. ✅ Completes PHASE 3b validation
3. ✅ Gives real performance data
4. ✅ Minimal additional setup
5. ✅ Sets baseline for future optimizations

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### If PostgREST is also unresponsive:
```bash
# Check if PostgREST is running
docker-compose ps supabase-rest

# Restart it
docker-compose restart supabase-rest

# Check logs
docker-compose logs supabase-rest 2>&1 | Select-Object -Last 20
```

### If you want to test Kong (after fix):
```bash
# Change BASE_URL to Kong
.\k6.exe run --env BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000 load-tests/badges-load.js

# Verify Kong health first
curl http://localhost:8000/rest/v1/badges_definitions?limit=1
```

### If k6 command not found:
```bash
# Use full path to k6
"c:\Users\cheic\Documents\EduSchool\guinee-academy\k6.exe" run load-tests/badges-load.js
```
