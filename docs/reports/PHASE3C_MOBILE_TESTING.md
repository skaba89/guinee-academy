## 📱 Mobile Stack

### Frontend (Capacitor Bridge)
- **Framework:** React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Capacitor:** v6.x (bridges web code to native APIs)
- **Plugins:** Camera, Geolocation, Push, Storage, Biometric
- **Build Target:** iOS 14+, Android API 24+

### Native Platforms
- **iOS:** Xcode 15+, Swift 5.9+
- **Android:** Android Studio Koala, API 24-35

### PWA Features
- **Offline:** Service Worker + Workbox 24h cache
- **Installation:** Add to home screen, app-like experience
- **Capabilities:** Camera access, notifications, biometrics
- **Storage:** IndexedDB for local data sync

## 🛠️ Installation & Configuration

### Step 1: Install Capacitor CLI
```bash
npm install -g @capacitor/cli@6.x
npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/ios @capacitor/android
npm install @capacitor/camera @capacitor/geolocation @capacitor/push-notifications
npm install @capacitor/local-notifications @capacitor/app
```

### Step 2: Build Production PWA
```bash
npm run build  # Vite build → dist/
```

### Step 3: Initialize Capacitor Project
```bash
npx cap init Guinée Academy-Pro com.guinee.academy
npx cap add ios
npx cap add android
```

### Step 4: Sync Native Code
```bash
npx cap sync  # Copies web app to native projects
```

### Step 5: Open IDE & Build
```bash
# iOS
npx cap open ios      # Opens Xcode
# → Select Team → Set signing → Build & Run

# Android  
npx cap open android  # Opens Android Studio
# → Build → Generate APK
```
