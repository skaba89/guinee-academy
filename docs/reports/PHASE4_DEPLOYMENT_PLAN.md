## 📋 Deployment Procedure

### Pre-Deployment (30 mins)

```bash
# 1. Database backup
pg_dump -h db-prod > backup-$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql

# 2. Verify health
curl https://api.guinee-academy.com/health

# 3. Alert team
# "Deployment starting - no new changes"

# 4. Run smoke tests
npm run test:e2e -- --smoke
```

### Deployment (30 mins)

```bash
# 1. Build production bundle
npm run build:production

# 2. Run migrations
npm run migrate:prod

# 3. Update docker images
docker pull guinee_academy:v1.0.0

# 4. Rolling restart (1 container at a time)
docker-compose up -d --no-deps --build api-1
docker-compose up -d --no-deps --build api-2
docker-compose up -d --no-deps --build api-3

# 5. Verify all services healthy
docker-compose ps | grep healthy

# 6. Run post-deployment tests
npm run test:smoke:post-deploy
```

### Post-Deployment (30 mins)

```bash
# 1. Verify key features
- Login as test user
- Navigate main pages
- Check database connections
- Verify file uploads

# 2. Monitor metrics
- Response times
- Error rates
- CPU/Memory usage

# 3. Alert team
# "Deployment successful"

# 4. Announce to users
# "Update complete - please refresh"
```

### Rollback Plan

```bash
# If critical issue detected:

# 1. Immediate rollback
docker-compose up -d --force-recreate api-1

# 2. Restore database (if needed)
psql -h db-prod < backup-YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.sql

# 3. Clear cache
redis-cli FLUSHALL

# 4. Notify team & users
```
